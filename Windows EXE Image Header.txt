All values except Palette Entries are 2 bytes long and are Least Significant Byte first; the start of a header is always aligned on a dword (4 byte) boundary.

Image data is same as BMP format.

For Type 1 images:
0x00	Header length in bytes (= 12)
0x02	= 0
0x04	Width
0x06	Height
0x08	= 1
0x0A	Bit depth
0x0C	Palette entries (BGR) - 3 bytes each - if image is not 1/4/8 bit, start of image data
If image is 1/4/8 bit:
0x0C + ((2 ^ Bit depth) * 3)	Start of image data

For Type 2 images:
0x00	Header length in bytes (= 40)
0x02	= 0
0x04	Width
0x06	= 0
0x08	Height
0x0A	= 0
0x0C	= 1
0x0E	Bit depth
0x10 to 0x12 = 0
0x14	???
0x16 to 0x26 = 0
0x28 Palette entries (BGR with padding) - 4 bytes each - if image is not 1/4/8 bit, start of image data
If image is 1/4/8 bit:
0x28 + ((2 ^ Bit depth) * 4)	Start of image data

The top half of cursors is the transparency mask and the bottom half is the actual cursor; for icons, the bottom half is the actual icon and editing the top half including through palette changes will corrupt the program.
